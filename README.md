# Why it is unique

* Registration form (/src/components/registrationForm/RegistrationForm.jsx) and the form hook(/src/common/hooks/Form.js) is designed as a component. you just need to copy the files and paste it in your project folder to use it.

* CSS is written in (/src/components/registrationForm/registrationForm.css) file.CSS is written in fully custom. no package is used.

* In this project vite is used rather than create-react-app. That will help develop and build faster.

* Color code is used via variable, that makes easy to remain constant in using color.

* CSS classes are written in a way that is easily readable.
