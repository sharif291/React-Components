# Why it is unique

Registration form (/components/registrationForm/RegistrationForm.jsx) and the form hook(/common/hooks/Form.js) is design as a component. you just need to copy the files and paste it in your project folder to use it.

CSS is written in (/components/registrationForm/registrationForm.css) file.CSS is written in fully custom. no package is used.

In this project vite is used rather than create-react-app. That will help develop and build faster.

Color code is used via variable, that makes easy to remain constant in using color.

CSS classes are written in a way that is easily readable.
